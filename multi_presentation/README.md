# MVC Calc Presentation on NLP
## By Joseph Yun

### These are slides for my multivarible presentation on March 14th 2024.
### You only need to do a few things to get this up and running
note: Tested on Python version 10

First: Download the file and go to its directory via some sort of commandline software.

For mac the command should be

```
cd ~/Downloads/multi_presentation
```

After that, run 

```
python -m http.server
```

And then navigate to:
```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

Other notes:
To move from first slide, left click and the rest can be navigated using the spacebar (I was wayyy to lazy to code in any more listeners so if it really annoys you add them yourself)

The other coding portion covered during the presentation is the file 
```
Cosine_similarity.ipynb
```
Alternatively... You can visit:
```

```

Also yes the code is messy but I did speedrun this presentation so cut me some slack
